# Wave Function Collapse using ASP

This repo contains the WFC algorithm implemented in Clingo using multi-shot solving via both a combinatorial approach as well as an incremental approach. To run the example, make sure Clingo is installed and run `wfc.sh` found in the corresponding folder (multi-shot/single-shot).
